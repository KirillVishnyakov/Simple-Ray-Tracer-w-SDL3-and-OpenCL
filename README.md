# Simple-Ray-Tracer-w-SDL3-and-OpenCL


A minimalistic path tracer implementation based on "Ray Tracing in a Weekend" series, built with SDL3 and OpenCL for GPU acceleration. This is a learning project focused on understanding the fundamentals of ray tracing and GPU computing.


## Disclaimer

This is a learning project! It's not optimized whatsoever and may contain bugs, inefficiencies, or unexpected behavior. I've only tested this on systems with AMD processors/GPUs.

## Features

GPU-accelerated path tracing using OpenCL

Real-time rendering with SDL3

Based on Peter Shirley's "Ray Tracing in a Weekend" concepts

Simple Cornell box scene with spheres

Progressive rendering with accumulating samples

## Prerequisites
CMake (version 3.15 or higher)

C++17 compatible compiler

OpenCL SDK (AMD, NVIDIA, or Intel)

SDL3 library

GPU with OpenCL support
